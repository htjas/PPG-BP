\section{Abstract}\label{sec:abstract}


\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\input{introduction}

\section{Theoretical Background}
\label{sec:background}
\input{theoretical-background}

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Data fetching and reading using WFDB and NumPy libraries.

\item Digital signal filtering using Savitzky-Golay and Butterworth Lowpass filters.

\item Beat detection algorithms from MIMIC WFDB Tutorial used for primary estimation.
Beat detection improved with manual implementation of SciPy library.

\item Fiducial Point calculation based on the algorithm provided in the MIMIC WFDB Tutorial.

\item Feature extraction with personally created code to extract time domain features, and NumPy library to extract frequency domain features (FFT). Median value calculation using NumPy library.

\item Machine Learning Model creation using PyTorch and Scikit-Learn libraries.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Data Fetching}
\label{subsec:data_fetching}

Data for Validation from MIMIC4:
5508 records each containing 37795 values corresponding to ~605 seconds (fs=64.4725);

Data for Training/Testing from MIMIC3 (1st Iteration):
306 records each containing 75625 values corresponding to 605 seconds (fs=125);

\subsection{Data Processing}
\label{subsec:data_processing}

Same Signaling processing approaches were included (see 4.2) for both the MIMIC4 and MIMIC3 data.

\subsection{Feature Extraction}
\label{subsec:feature_extraction}

CAVE: out of the 34 features, 2 (delta T and resistive index) depend on the accurate detection of the dicrotic notch.
Significantly more values can be extracted if finding the dicrotic notch would not be necessary

FE from MIMIC4:
- For target reference Systolic, Diastolic and MAP values were extracted from the waveform data.
- For Machine Learning, 34 features were extracted from the PPG waveform
A total of n values were extracted, resulting in a 34 x n matrix.
Total of m median values were extracted

FE 1st iteration from MIMIC3:

- For target reference ABP Systolic and Diastolic values were extracted from the waveform data.
- For Machine Learning, 34 features were extracted from the PPG waveform
A total of 161,269 values were extracted, resulting in a 34x161269 matrix.
Total of 14,958 median values were extracted

\subsection{Machine Learning}
\label{subsec:machine_learning}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

Limitations:
- not knowing what devices were used
- how they were calibrated
- how accurate they are
- pulse oximeter and arterial catheter parameters
- sampling rates are different for every device (even between MIMIC 3 and 4)

Possible Improvements:
- integrate both the ECG and PPG graphs for a more precise prediction
- use further signal processing approaches
- manually filter waveform graphics (e.g.\ faulty PPG signal)
- expand on machine learning algorithms
