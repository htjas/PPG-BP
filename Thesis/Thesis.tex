    \section{Results}
    \label{sec:results}

    \subsection{Data Fetching}
    \label{subsec:data_fetching}

    Data for Validation from MIMIC4:
    5508 records each containing 37795 values corresponding to ~605 seconds (fs=64.4725);

    Data for Training/Testing from MIMIC3 (1st Iteration):
    22083 (~4*MIMIC4) records each containing 75625 values corresponding to 605 seconds (fs=125);

    \subsection{Data Processing}
    \label{subsec:data_processing}

    Same Signaling processing approaches were included (see 4.2) for both the MIMIC4 and MIMIC3 data.

    \subsection{Feature Extraction}
    \label{subsec:feature_extraction}

    CAVE: out of the 34 features, 2 (delta T and resistive index) depend on the accurate detection of the dicrotic notch.
    Significantly more values can be extracted if finding the dicrotic notch would not be necessary

    FE from MIMIC4 for Validation:
    - For target reference Systolic, Diastolic and MAP values were extracted from the waveform data.
    - For Machine Learning, 34 features were extracted from the PPG waveform
    A total of \textbf{1,309,265} values were extracted, resulting in a 34 x 1,309,265 matrix.
    Total of \textbf{183,140} median values were extracted.

    FE from MIMIC3 for Training/Testing:

    - For target reference ABP Systolic, Diastolic and MAP values were extracted from the waveform data.
    - For Machine Learning, 34 features were extracted from the PPG waveform
    A total of \textbf{13,659,375} values were extracted, resulting in a 34 x 13659375 matrix.
    Total of \textbf{1,918,623} median values were extracted.

    The summarized results are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:data_flow}.

    \section{Discussion}
    \label{sec:discussion}

    Limitations:
    - not knowing what devices were used
    - how they were calibrated
    - how accurate they are
    - pulse oximeter and arterial catheter parameters
    - sampling rates are different for every device (even between MIMIC 3 and 4)

    Possible Improvements:
    - integrate both the ECG and PPG graphs for a more precise prediction
    - use further signal processing approaches
    - manually filter waveform graphics (e.g.\ faulty PPG signal)
    - expand on machine learning algorithms
    - experiment with different median intervals
