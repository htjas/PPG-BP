    \section{Discussion}
    \label{sec:discussion}

    Caveats:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Out of the 34 features, 3 (delta\_t, delta\_area and res\_index) depend on the accurate detection of the dicrotic notch.
        \item Significantly more values could be extracted if finding the dicrotic notch would not be necessary.
    \end{itemize}

    % more effi sp for mimic3
    All this means is that the signal processing algorithms worked better and extracted more values from the MIMIC-III DB.
    It is also possible a hint at the fact, that the quality of the signal was better in MIMIC-III.
    This is also logical however, since there was no limit on the fetching of records from a single study or subject from MIMIC-IV,
    so huge number of segments might have been discarded, if they didn't showcase a comprehensible signal.

    % feature reduction
    It was found, that every feature contributes positively, therefore feature reduction was not applied.

    Limitations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Not knowing what devices were used.
        \item How they were calibrated.
        \item How accurate they are.
        \item Pulse oximeter and arterial catheter parameters.
        \item Sampling rates are different for every device (even between MIMIC 3 and 4).
    \end{itemize}

    Possible Improvements:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Integrate both the ECG and PPG graphs for a more precise prediction.
        \item Use further signal processing approaches.
        \item Manually filter waveform graphics (e.g., faulty PPG signal).
        \item Expand on machine learning algorithms.
        \item Experiment with different median intervals.
    \end{itemize}


    \section{Conclusion}
    \label{sec:conclusion}

    Summary of findings:

    As per the joint 2018 statement by the American National Standards of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), European Society of Hypertension (ESH)
    and International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the average variation and its standard deviation in NIBP measurements should ideally fall within 5 ± 8 mmHg compared to a reference BP,
    based on a minimum of 85 patient evaluations~\cite{stergiouUniversalStandardValidation2018}.

    The number of patient evaluations done in this study greatly exceed 85.
    The average variation and standard deviation of given models was: -||-

    Pretty bad performance on a huge number of data.
    Very important though, that no overfitting was done.
    Also, real-world data was simulated through MIMIC-IV (completely different data source), which is key.

    Advanced NN models performed well but not extraordinarily great.
    RF had a promising test loss, but validation loss was even worse than of LSTMs and GRUs.

    This study focused on ICU patient data, but it can prospectively be expanded on also ambulatory patients or even real-time healthy patient monitoring.
