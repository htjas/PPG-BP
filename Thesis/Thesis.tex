\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Data fetching and reading using WFDB and NumPy libraries.

\item Digital signal filtering using Savitzky-Golay and Butterworth Lowpass filters.

\item Beat detection algorithms from MIMIC WFDB Tutorial used for primary estimation.
Beat detection improved with manual implementation of SciPy library.

\item Fiducial Point calculation based on the algorithm provided in the MIMIC WFDB Tutorial.

\item Feature extraction with personally created code to extract time domain features, and NumPy library to extract frequency domain features (FFT). Median value calculation using NumPy library.

\item Machine Learning Model creation using PyTorch and Scikit-Learn libraries.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

1st iteration:

306 records of 10 minutes each were extracted from the MIMIC-III Database for creation (training and testing) of a Machine Learning model.
Signaling processing approaches were included (see 4.2).
Feature extraction:
- For target reference ABP Systolic and Diastolic values were extracted from the waveform data.
- For Machine Learning, 34 features were extracted from the PPG waveform
A total of 161269 values were extracted, resulting in a 34x161269 matrix.
