\label{subsec:results_data}

The results section commences with the presentation of Table~\ref{tab:records}, which summarizes the data retrieval phase.
Displayed within are the total records obtained from both databases, along with the corresponding total and median values extracted.

    \label{tab:records}
\end{table}

In a brief summary of the table data, 5,508 records were retrieved from the MIMIC-IV database, each encompassing 37,795 values, equating to approximately 605 seconds of data (at a sampling rate of 64.4725).
Conversely, a total of 22,083 records were obtained from the MIMIC-IV dataset, representing four times the number of records in comparison to MIMIC-IV\@.
Each of these records consisted of 75,625 values, likewise corresponding to an approximate duration of 10 minutes (with a sampling rate of 125).

Conversely, 4 times the records of MIMIC-IV were fetched, namely 22,083, each containing 75625 values also corresponding to approx.\ 10 minutes (sampling rate of 125).

Subsequently, the process of Feature Extraction from both DBs commenced, involving the extraction of 34 training features along with their corresponding values from the PPG waveforms,
as well as the target reference values for SBP, DBP, and MAP from the ABP signal.

From the MIMIC-IV dataset, a total of 1,309,265 values were extracted, leading to the creation of 34 x 1,309,265 PPG and 3 x 1,309,265 ABP data matrices.
Additionally, 183,140 median values were derived from these matrices, forming datasets of the same X-axis dimensions.
This set of data was utilized for the validation phase.

In the case of the MIMIC-III dataset, a total of 13,659,375 values were extracted, resulting in 34 x 13,659,375 PPG and 3 x 13,659,375 ABP data matrices.
Similarly, 1,918,623 median values were obtained from these matrices, creating datasets with identical X-axis structures.
These datasets were employed for the purposes of training and testing.

The data flow is visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:data_flow}.

\subsection{Machine Learning}
\label{subsec:machine_learning}

Moving forward to the results stemming from the ML phase, the initial focus lies on the preparation of feature data.

As outlined in previous chapters, the intended split ratio of 60/20/20 for train/test/validation could not be precisely achieved due to the final dataset sizes of 1,918,623 values from MIMIC-III and 183,140 values from MIMIC-IV\@.
Consequently, the MIMIC-III dataset was utilized for training and testing, being split into an 80/20 ratio for train/test, resulting in 1,534,898 training datapoints and 383,725 testing datapoints.
Thus, the ultimate distribution for train/test/validate proportions became:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Training  & Testing & Validation \\
        \hline
        1,534,898 & 383,725 & 183,140    \\
        \hline
        73\%      & 18\%    & 9\%        \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

After implementing the 7 ML models outlined in the Methods section~\ref{subsec:ml_methods} and employing the described training method with an \enquote{early stopping} strategy,
along with validation on \enquote{unseen} simulated \enquote{real-world} (MIMIC-IV) data, a comprehensive set of performance metrics was compiled.
Firstly, the training and testing losses, measured through MSE at the conclusion of training epochs, were documented.
Secondly, the overall testing accuracy was assessed using RMSE and MAE metrics.
Lastly, the validation loss, also utilizing RMSE and MAE, was computed.

All \textit{PyTorch} models were additionally executed alongside their \enquote{weight adjusted} (WA) counterparts, with the respective metrics recorded.

The relevant ML model testing logs and performance metrics, including RMSE, MAE, \textit{$R^2$}, Bias and LoA are documented in Appendix~\ref{subsec:misc_measures}.

The plots depicting feature importance, along with their corresponding weight values from the second iteration of the ML models, are available in Appendix~\ref{subsec:plots_fi}.

The final results of all ML models for predicting ABP (SBP, DBP and MAP) are available in the Tables~\ref{tab:train_test_mse} and~\ref{tab:test_validate_rmse_mae}.

The validated prediction accuracy of different BP measurements across all ML models is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:all_mae}.

\subsubsection{Feature Importance}

Based on the iterative evaluation approach described in the methods section, the feature importance values were systematically analyzed, highlighting their impact on the model's performance.
The plots, available in the Appendix~\ref{subsec:plots_fi}, showcase these values in a descending order, revealing the features' contributions to either enhancing or diminishing the model's predictive power.
From the obtained results, a portion of the features can be categorized into three groups based on their average importance values.

In the category of best performers, features such as
\begin{itemize}
    \item Diastolic Time (86.89),
    \item Resistive Index (67.31),
    \item Diastolic + Systolic Width at 50\% (50.6) and
    \item Normalized Power at Peak (46.72)
\end{itemize}
stood out prominently, demonstrating significant influence in improving the models' accuracy.

In the medium-performing group, features like
\begin{itemize}
    \item Delta Area (37.12),
    \item Vessel Volume Systolic Index (23.61),
    \item Systolic Area and
    \item Total Power (both with values of 20.79), also
    \item Diastolic Width at 66\% (17.66) and
    \item Vessel Volume Diastolic Index (14.27),
\end{itemize}
contributed moderately to the overall predictive capability.

Lastly, in the category of least influential features
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mean Frequency (3.51)
    \item and Ratio of Diastolic to Systolic Width at 75\% (2.12)
\end{itemize}
showed minimal impact on the models' performance.

The Table~\ref{tab:test_validate_rmse_mae} provides an overview of the testing and validation performance metrics for the Machine Learning models employed.

For the LR model, the test MAE and RMSE were recorded as 11.091 and 14.739 respectively, with the validation MAE at 13.171 and RMSE at 16.219.
Similarly, the LR WA model exhibited comparable metrics with slightly higher validation MAE and RMSE values.

Moving to the MLP model, it displayed a test MAE of 10.567 and a test RMSE of 14.005, with the validation metrics showing an MAE of 14.096 and RMSE of 18.781.
The MLP WA model significantly increased the validation losses MAE and RMSE to 21.309 and 30.559 respectively, displaying the worst performance of all models.

In contrast, the LSTM model showed improved performance with a test MAE of 7.119 and a test RMSE of 10.073.
The validation metrics for LSTM were recorded as an MAE of 14.158 and RMSE of 18.005.

\end{figure}

The bar chart depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:all_mae} showcases the average validation MAE for distinct BP measurements.
Among the categories of Total, Systolic, Diastolic, and Mean Arterial Pressure, notable disparities in error levels were evident.

The overall average validation MAE, calculated across all models, was 14.648.
However, the individual measures displayed significant deviations.

Particularly, the most considerable MAE was observed for SBP at 20.105, indicating a pronounced level of error.
A substantial reduction in MAE was notable for DBP, nearly halving the error observed for SBP, with a recorded MAE of 11.032, marking the lowest among the measurements.
Meanwhile, MAP exhibited the second lowest MAE, closely trailing DBP at 12.809.

These findings offer valuable insights into the predictive performance of the model across distinct BP parameters,
with SBP presenting the highest margin of error, while DBP and MAP indicating relatively lower levels of error.
