  abstract = {Beat detection algorithms have many clinical applications including pulse oximetry, cardiac arrhythmia detection, and cardiac output monitoring. Most of these algorithms have been developed by medical device companies and are proprietary. Thus, researchers who wish to investigate pulse contour analysis must rely on manual annotations or develop their own algorithms. We designed an automatic detection algorithm for pressure signals that locates the first peak following each heart beat. This is called the percussion peak in intracranial pressure (ICP) signals and the systolic peak in arterial blood pressure (ABP) and pulse oximetry (SpO2) signals. The algorithm incorporates a filter bank with variable cutoff frequencies, spectral estimates of the heart rate, rank-order nonlinear filters, and decision logic. We prospectively measured the performance of the algorithm compared to expert annotations of ICP, ABP, and SpO2 signals acquired from pediatric intensive care unit patients. The algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 99.36\% and positive predictivity of 98.43\% on a dataset consisting of 42,539 beats.},

  abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple and low-cost optical technique that can be used to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. It is often used non-invasively to make measurements at the skin surface. The PPG waveform comprises a pulsatile (‘AC’) physiological waveform attributed to cardiac synchronous changes in the blood volume with each heart beat, and is superimposed on a slowly varying (‘DC’) baseline with various lower frequency components attributed to respiration, sympathetic nervous system activity and thermoregulation. Although the origins of the components of the PPG signal are not fully understood, it is generally accepted that they can provide valuable information about the cardiovascular system. There has been a resurgence of interest in the technique in recent years, driven by the demand for low cost, simple and portable technology for the primary care and community based clinical settings, the wide availability of low cost and small semiconductor components, and the advancement of computer-based pulse wave analysis techniques. The PPG technology has been used in a wide range of commercially available medical devices for measuring oxygen saturation, blood pressure and cardiac output, assessing autonomic function and also detecting peripheral vascular disease. The introductory sections of the topical review describe the basic principle of operation and interaction of light with tissue, early and recent history of PPG, instrumentation, measurement protocol, and pulse wave analysis. The review then focuses on the applications of PPG in clinical physiological measurements, including clinical physiological monitoring, vascular assessment and autonomic function.},

  abstract = {Low-amplitude PPG signals are more affected by noise contamination and other undesirable effects because the signal strength is comparable to noise power. Although several authors claim that decreases in the amplitude of the PPG wave should be addressed from signal acquisition and conditioning stages such decreases can also be associated with changes in the patient condition. In that instance, it is important to ensure continuous and reliable HR monitoring which, in turn, depends on how robust is the peak detection method. Numerous efforts have been made to develop algorithms for accurate PPG peak detection under high motion artefact conditions. However, little has been done regarding peak detection in low-amplitude PPG signals. In an attempt to address this issue, a novel and simple peak detection algorithm for PPG signals was proposed. Results show that our method could be a good contribution for robust strategies that can dynamically adapt their peak detection method to circumstances in which a decrease in the amplitude of the PPG signal is expected. Still, more extensive testing under a wide range of conditions (e.g. intensive physical exercise) is needed to perform a rigorous validation.},

The study used a cross-sectional survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States, including an in-home interview and a clinic examination, each of which included measurement of blood pressure. Data for 9901 participants 18 years of age and older from phase 1 of the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, collected from 1988 through 1991, were used. Twenty-four percent of the US adult population representing 43 186 000 persons had hypertension. The age-adjusted prevalence in the non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and Mexican American populations was 32.4\%, 23.3\%, and 22.6\%, respectively. Overall, two thirds of the population with hypertension were aware of their diagnosis (69\%), and a majority were taking prescribed medication (53\%). Only one third of Mexican Americans with hypertension were being treated(35\%), and only 14\% achieved control in contrast to 25\% and 24\% of the non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white populations with hypertension, respectively. Almost 13 million adults classified as being normotensive reported being told on one or more occasions that they had hypertension; 51\% of this group reported current adherence to lifestyle changes to control their hypertension. Hypertension continues to be a common finding in the general population. Awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension have improved substantially since the 1976-1980 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey but continue to be suboptimal, especially in Mexican Americans. Consideration should be given to revision of the criteria for classification of hypertension to reflect the widespread use of lifestyle modification for treatment of hypertension.},

PPG is a non-invasive technology that uses a light source and a photodetector at the surface of skin to measure the volumetric variations of blood circulation. Recently, there has been much interest from numerous researchers around the globe to extract further valuable information from the PPG signal in addition to heart rate estimation and pulse oxymetry readings. PPG signal’s second derivative wave contains important health-related information. Thus, analysis of this waveform can help researchers and clinicians to evaluate various cardiovascular-related diseases such as atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness. Moreover, investigating the second derivative wave of PPG signal can also assist in early detection and diagnosis of various cardiovascular illnesses that may possibly appear later in life. For early recognition and analysis of such illnesses, continuous and real-time monitoring is an important approach that has been enabled by the latest technological advances in sensor technology and wireless communications. The aim of this article is to briefly consider some of the current developments and challenges of wearable PPG-based monitoring technologies and then to discuss some of the potential applications of this technology in clinical settings.},

The shape and timing of the PPG pulse wave are both influenced by normal vascular aging, changes in arterial stiffness and blood pressure, and atherosclerosis. This review summarizes research into assessing vascular age from the PPG. Three categories of approaches are described: 1) those which use a single PPG signal (based on pulse wave analysis), 2) those which use multiple PPG signals (such as pulse transit time measurement), and 3) those which use PPG and other signals (such as pulse arrival time measurement). Evidence is then presented on the performance, repeatability and reproducibility, and clinical utility of PPG-derived parameters of vascular age. Finally, the review outlines key directions for future research to realize the full potential of photoplethysmography for assessing vascular age.},

  abstract = {The definition of mean arterial pressure (MAP) is the average arterial pressure throughout one cardiac cycle, systole, and diastole. MAP is influenced by cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance, each of which is influenced by several variables. These will be discussed further under the Mechanism heading of this article. Cardiac output is calculated as the product of heart rate and stroke volume. The determination of stroke volume is by ventricular inotropy and preload. Preload is affected by blood volume and the compliance of veins. Increasing the blood volume increases the preload, increasing the stroke volume and therefore increasing cardiac output. Afterload also affects the stroke volume in that an increase in afterload will decrease stroke volume. Heart rate is affected by the chronotropy, dromotropy, and lusitropy of the myocardium. Systemic vascular resistance is determined primarily by the radius of the blood vessels. Decreasing the radius of the vessels increases vascular resistance. Increasing the radius of the vessels would have the opposite effect. Blood viscosity can also affect systemic vascular resistance. An increase in hematocrit will increase blood viscosity and increase systemic vascular resistance. Viscosity, however, is considered only to play a minor role in systemic vascular resistance. A common method used to estimate the MAP is the following formula: MAP = DP + 1/3(SP~–~DP) or MAP = DP + 1/3(PP). Where DP is the diastolic blood pressure, SP is the systolic blood pressure, and PP is the pulse pressure. This method is often more conducive to measuring MAP in most clinical settings as it offers a quick means of calculation if the blood pressure is known.},

  abstract = {For over 90~years, researchers and clinicians have worked on systems to noninvasively measure pulse wave velocity, with the ultimate goal of measuring continuous, cuffless blood-pressure. The design of multisensor systems to make two or more measurements of the pulse wave along the human arterial tree has become the hallmark of these efforts. Pulse arrival time measurements are traditionally made by detecting a first fiducial point on the electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform, and second fiducial point on a distal pulsatile waveform, such as the photoplethysmogram (PPG) or impedance cardiogram (ICG). By looking at the time difference between these two fiducial points, an approximation for pulse wave velocity can be calculated. Some other challenges exist in transforming the pulse arrival times into absolute blood pressure, but these have been largely overcome, as evidenced by the clinical-grade systems that are commercially available in the marketplace today.},

  abstract = {Hypertension or high blood pressure is a major health problem worldwide and primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Blood pressure is one of the four vital signs that provides important information regarding patients’ cardiovascular system conditions. Continuous and regular blood pressure monitoring is essential for early diagnosis and prevention of cardiovascular disease. Considering the existing invasive or cuff-based blood pressuring monitoring techniques in clinical practice, several studies have identified motivation and advantages of a new non-invasive and cuffless blood pressuring measurement technique using Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. In this study, we propose several systolic and diastolic blood pressure estimation models using recurrent neural networks with bidirectional connections and attention mechanism utilising only PPG signals. The models were evaluated on PPG and blood pressure signals derived from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II database. In the process, 22 characteristic features were extracted from the PPG waveform followed by various dimensionality reduction techniques to eliminate redundancies and reduce computational complexity. The proposed models were evaluated on both the 22-feature set and the reduced input feature vector, respectively. The models were compared with four machine learning techniques commonly used in the literature. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed models could capture the non-linear relationship between the PPG features and blood pressure with high accuracy and outperformed the conventional machine learning methods on both datasets. The results for all the proposed models were acceptable by the global standards set by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation for cuffless blood pressure estimation.},

  abstract = {Hypertension or high blood pressure is a leading cause of death throughout the world and a critical factor for increasing the risk of serious diseases, including cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and heart failure. Blood pressure is a primary vital sign that must be monitored regularly for the early detection, prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Traditional blood pressure measurement techniques are either invasive or cuff-based, which are impractical, intermittent, and uncomfortable for patients. Over the past few decades, several indirect approaches using photoplethysmogram (PPG) have been investigated, namely, pulse transit time, pulse wave velocity, pulse arrival time and pulse wave analysis, in an effort to utilise PPG for estimating blood pressure. Recent advancements in signal processing techniques, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, have also opened up exciting new horizons for PPG-based cuff less and continuous monitoring of blood pressure. Such a device will have a significant and transformative impact in monitoring patients’ vital signs, especially those at risk of cardiovascular disease. This paper provides a comprehensive review for non-invasive cuff-less blood pressure estimation using the PPG approach along with their challenges and limitations.},

Researchers from different domains of science have become increasingly interested in PPG because of its advantages as non-invasive, inexpensive, and convenient diagnostic tool. Traditionally, it measures the oxygen saturation, blood pressure, cardiac output, and for assessing autonomic functions. Moreover, PPG is a promising technique for early screening of various atherosclerotic pathologies and could be helpful for regular GP-assessment but a full understanding of the diagnostic value of the different features is still lacking. Recent studies emphasise the potential information embedded in the PPG waveform signal and it deserves further attention for its possible applications beyond pulse oximetry and heart-rate calculation. Therefore, this overview discusses different types of artifact added to PPG signal, characteristic features of PPG waveform, and existing indexes to evaluate for diagnoses.},

However, processing PPG signals measured after exercise is challenging, especially if the environment is hot and humid. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that can detect systolic peaks under challenging conditions, as in the case of emergency responders in tropical conditions. Accurate systolic-peak detection is an important first step for the analysis of heart rate variability. Algorithms based on local maxima-minima, first-derivative, and slope sum are evaluated, and a new algorithm is introduced to improve the detection rate. With 40 healthy subjects, the new algorithm demonstrates the highest overall detection accuracy (99.84\% sensitivity, 99.89\% positive predictivity). Existing algorithms, such as Billauer's, Li's and Zong's, have comparable although lower accuracy. However, the proposed algorithm presents an advantage for real-time applications by avoiding human intervention in threshold determination. For best performance, we show that a combination of two event-related moving averages with an offset threshold has an advantage in detecting systolic peaks, even in heat-stressed PPG signals.},

  abstract = {Background Reliable and comparable analysis of risks to health is key for preventing disease and injury. Causal attribution of morbidity and mortality to risk factors has traditionally been in the context of individual risk factors, Often in a limited number of settings, restricting comparability. Our aim was to estimate the contributions of selected major risk factors to global and regional burden of disease in a unified framework. Methods For 26 selected risk factors, expert working groups undertook a comprehensive review of published work and other sources-eg, government reports and international databases-to obtain data on the prevalence of risk factor exposure and hazard size for 14 epidemiological regions of the world. Population attributable fractions were estimated by applying the potential impact fraction relation, and applied to the mortality and burden of disease estimates from the global burden of disease (GBD) database. Findings Childhood and maternal underweight (138 million disability adjusted life years [DALY], 9·5\%), unsafe sex (92 million DALY, 6·3\%), high blood pressure (64 million DALY, 4·4\%), tobacco (59 million DALY, 4·1\%), and alcohol (58 million DALY, 4·0\%) were the leading causes of global burden of disease. In the poorest regions of the world, childhood and maternal underweight, unsafe sex, unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene, indoor smoke from solid fuels, and various micronutrient deficiencies were major contributors to loss of healthy life. In both developing and developed regions, alcohol, tobacco, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol were major causes of disease burden. Interpretation Substantial proportions of global disease burden are attributable to these major risks, to an extent greater than previously estimated. Developing countries suffer most or all of the burden due to many of the leading risks. Strategies that target these known risks can provide substantial and underestimated public-health gains.

The technology is based on pulse wave analysis (PWA) of PPG signals retrieved from different body locations to continuously estimate the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The proposed algorithm extracts morphological features from the PPG signal and maps them to SBP and DBP values using a multiple linear regression (MLR) model. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on the publicly available Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC I) database. We utilize 28 data-sets (records) that contain both PPG and brachial arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. The collected PPG and ABP signals are synchronized and divided into intervals of 30 seconds, called epochs. In total, we utilize 47153 clean 30-second epochs for the performance analysis. Out of the 28 data-sets, we use only 2 data-sets with a total of 2677 clean 30-second epochs to build the MLR model of the algorithm. For the SBP, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.10 mmHg between the arterial line and the PPG-based values are achieved, with a Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.90, p = .001. For the DBP, and an MAE of 4.65 mmHg between the arterial line and the PPG-based values are achieved, with a Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.85, p .001. We also use a binary classifier for the BP values with the positives indicating SBP ≥ 130 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 80 mmHg and the negatives indicating otherwise. The classifier results generated by the PPG-based SBP and DBP estimates achieve a sensitivity and a specificity of 79.11\% and 92.37\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {In two-thirds of intensive care unit (ICU) patients and 90\% of surgical patients, arterial blood pressure (ABP) is monitored non-invasively but intermittently using a blood pressure cuff. Since even a few minutes of hypotension increases the risk of mortality and morbidity, for the remaining (high-risk) patients ABP is measured continuously using invasive devices, and derived values are extracted from the recorded waveforms. However, since invasive monitoring is associated with major complications (infection, bleeding, thrombosis), the ideal ABP monitor should be both non-invasive and continuous. With large volumes of high-fidelity physiological waveforms, it may be possible today to impute a physiological waveform from other available signals. Currently, the state-of-the-art approaches for ABP imputation only aim at intermittent systolic and diastolic blood pressure imputation, and there is no method that imputes the continuous ABP waveform. Here, we developed a novel approach to impute the continuous ABP waveform non-invasively using two continuously-monitored waveforms that are currently part of the standard-of-care, the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photo-plethysmogram (PPG), by adapting a deep learning architecture designed for image segmentation. Using over 150,000~min of data collected at two separate health systems from 463 patients, we demonstrate that our model provides a highly accurate prediction of the continuous ABP waveform (root mean square error 5.823 (95\% CI 5.806–5.840) mmHg), as well as the derived systolic (mean difference 2.398\,±\,5.623~mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (mean difference −\,2.497\,±\,3.785~mmHg) compared to arterial line measurements. Our approach can potentially be used to measure blood pressure continuously and non-invasively for all patients in the acute care setting, without the need for any additional instrumentation beyond the current standard-of-care.},

Finapres is an acronym for FINger Arterial PRESsure, the device delivers a continuous finger arterial pressure waveform. Many papers report on the accuracy of the device in comparison with intra-arterial or with noninvasive but intermittent blood pressure measurements. We compiled the results of 43 such papers and found systolic, diastolic and mean accuracies, in this order, ranging from -48 to 30 mmHg, from -20 to 18 mmHg, and from -13 to 25 mmHg. Weighted for the number of subjects included pooled accuracies were -0.8 (SD 11.9), -1.6 (8.3) and -1.6 (7.6) mmHg respectively. Subdividing the pooled group according to criteria such as reference blood pressure, place of application, and prototype or commercial device we found no significant differences in mean differences or SD. Measurement at the finger allows uninterrupted recordings of long duration. The transmission of the pressure pulse along the arm arteries, however, causes distortion of the pulse waveform and depression of the mean blood pressure level. These effects can be reduced by appropriate filtering, and upper arm 'return-to-flow' calibration to bring accuracy and precision within AAMI limits. For the assessment of beat-to-beat changes in blood pressure and assessment of blood pressure variability Finapres proved a reliable alternative for invasive measurements when mean and diastolic pressures are concerned. Differences in systolic pressure are larger and reach statistical significance but are not of clinical relevance. Finger arteries are affected by contraction and dilatation in relation to psychological and physical (heat, cold, blood loss, orthostasis) stress. Effects of these phenomena are reduced by the built-in Physiocal algorithm. However, full smooth muscle contraction should be avoided in the awake patient by comforting the patient, and coveting the hand. Arterial state can be monitored by observing the behaviour of the Physiocal algorithm. We conclude that Finapres accuracy and precision usually suffice for reliable tracking of changes in blood pressure. Diagnostic accuracy may be achieved with future application of corrective measures.},

  abstract = {Continuous, comfortable, convenient (C3), and accurate blood pressure (BP) measurement and monitoring are needed for early diagnosis of various cardiovascular diseases. To supplement the limited C3 BP measurement of existing cuff-based BP technologies, though they may achieve reliable accuracy, cuffless BP measurement technologies, such as pulse transit/arrival time, pulse wave analysis, and image processing, have been studied to obtain C3 BP measurement. One of the recent cuffless BP measurement technologies, innovative machine-learning and artificial intelligence-based technologies that can estimate BP by extracting BP-related features from photoplethysmography (PPG)-based waveforms have attracted interdisciplinary attention of the medical and computer scientists owing to their handiness and effectiveness for both C3 and accurate, i.e., C3A, BP measurement. However, C3A BP measurement remains still unattainable because the accuracy of the existing PPG-based BP methods was not sufficiently justified for subject-independent and highly varying BP, which is a typical case in practice. To circumvent this issue, a novel convolutional neural network(CNN)- and calibration-based model (PPG2BP-Net) was designed by using a comparative paired one-dimensional CNN structure to estimate highly varying intrasubject BP.

  abstract = {Introduction. Blood pressure (BP) has been a potential risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. BP measurement is one of the most useful parameters for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. At present, BP measurement mainly relies on cuff-based techniques that cause inconvenience and discomfort to users. Although some of the present prototype cuffless BP measurement techniques are able to reach overall acceptable accuracies, they require an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a photoplethysmograph (PPG) that make them unsuitable for true wearable applications. Therefore, developing a single PPG-based cuffless BP estimation algorithm with enough accuracy would be clinically and practically useful. Methods. The University of Queensland vital sign dataset (online database) was accessed to extract raw PPG signals and its corresponding reference BPs (systolic BP and diastolic BP). The online database consisted of PPG waveforms of 32 cases from whom 8133 (good quality) signal segments (5\,s for each) were extracted, preprocessed, and normalised in both width and amplitude. Three most significant pulse features (pulse area, pulse rising time, and width 25\%) with their corresponding reference BPs were used to train and test three machine learning algorithms (regression tree, multiple linear regression (MLR), and support vector machine (SVM)). A 10-fold cross-validation was applied to obtain overall BP estimation accuracy, separately for the three machine learning algorithms. Their estimation accuracies were further analysed separately for three clinical BP categories (normotensive, hypertensive, and hypotensive). Finally, they were compared with the ISO standard for noninvasive BP device validation (average difference no greater than 5\,mmHg and SD no greater than 8\,mmHg). Results. In terms of overall estimation accuracy, the regression tree achieved the best overall accuracy for SBP (mean and SD of difference: −0.1\,±\,6.5\,mmHg) and DBP (mean and SD of difference: −0.6\,±\,5.2\,mmHg). MLR and SVM achieved the overall mean difference less than 5\,mmHg for both SBP and DBP, but their SD of difference was {$>$}8\,mmHg. Regarding the estimation accuracy in each BP categories, only the regression tree achieved acceptable ISO standard for SBP (−1.1\,±\,5.7\,mmHg) and DBP (−0.03\,±\,5.6\,mmHg) in the normotensive category. MLR and SVM did not achieve acceptable accuracies in any BP categories. Conclusion. This study developed and compared three machine learning algorithms to estimate BPs using PPG only and revealed that the regression tree algorithm was the best approach with overall acceptable accuracy to ISO standard for BP device validation. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the regression tree algorithm achieved acceptable measurement accuracy only in the normotensive category, suggesting that future algorithm development for BP estimation should be more specific for different BP categories.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors have been increasingly used for remote patient monitoring, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, for the management of chronic diseases and neurological disorders. There is an urgent need to evaluate the accuracy of these devices. This scoping review considers the latest applications of wearable PPG sensors with a focus on studies that used wearable PPG sensors to monitor various health parameters. The primary objective is to report the accuracy of the PPG sensors in both real-world and clinical settings. Methods: This scoping review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). Studies were identified by querying the Medline, Embase, IEEE, and CINAHL databases. The goal was to capture eligible studies that used PPG sensors to monitor various health parameters for populations with a minimum of 30 participants, with at least some of the population having relevant health issues. A total of 2,996 articles were screened and 28 are included in this review. Results: The health parameters and disorders identified and investigated in this study include heart rate and heart rate variability, atrial fibrillation, blood pressure (BP), obstructive sleep apnea, blood glucose, heart failure, and respiratory rate. An overview of the algorithms used, and their limitations is provided. Conclusion: Some of the barriers identified in evaluating the accuracy of multiple types of wearable devices include the absence of reporting standard accuracy metrics and a general paucity of studies with large subject size in real-world settings, especially for parameters such as BP.},

The arteries, obtained at autopsy within 48 h after death, were stored in glucose-free Tyrode at 4 degrees C. Experiments began within 40 h after autopsy. The diameter responses to various transmural pressure changes, with and without the addition of noradrenaline to the Tyrode solution in the specimen chamber, were compared with the responses of freshly excised rat tail arteries. In general, pressure-diameter relations of human finger artery segments were similar to those of rat tail artery segments, with a steep slope in the collapse region near zero pressure. Also, spontaneous rhythmic contractions and myogenic activity induced by high transmural pressures were similar to those observed in the fresh rat tail arteries. Human finger arteries, however, could contract to complete closure both spontaneously and after addition of noradrenaline, while rat tail arteries did not. The diameter changes of the arterial segments during forced 1 Hz oscillations of 20-50 mm Hg (2.7-6.7 kPa) amplitude superimposed on a mean transmural pressure were substantially smaller than those during quasi-steady inflation-deflation ramps over the same pressure range, indicating the presence of a strong viscous wall component.},

  abstract = {Objective Minimal clinical research has investigated the significance of different blood pressure monitoring techniques in the ICU and whether systolic vs. mean blood pressures should be targeted in therapeutic protocols and in defining clinical study cohorts. The objectives of this study are to compare real-world invasive arterial blood pressure with noninvasive blood pressure, and to determine if differences between the two techniques have clinical implications. Design We conducted a retrospective study comparing invasive arterial blood pressure and noninvasive blood pressure measurements using a large ICU database. We performed pairwise comparison between concurrent measures of invasive arterial blood pressure and noninvasive blood pressure. We studied the association of systolic and mean invasive arterial blood pressure and noninvasive blood pressure with acute kidney injury, and with ICU mortality. Setting Adult intensive care units at a tertiary care hospital. Patients Adult patients admitted to intensive care units between 2001 and 2007. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results Pairwise analysis of 27,022 simultaneously measured invasive arterial blood pressure/noninvasive blood pressure pairs indicated that noninvasive blood pressure overestimated systolic invasive arterial blood pressure during hypotension. Analysis of acute kidney injury and ICU mortality involved 1,633 and 4,957 patients, respectively. Our results indicated that hypotensive systolic noninvasive blood pressure readings were associated with a higher acute kidney injury prevalence (p = 0.008) and ICU mortality (p {$<$} 0.001) than systolic invasive arterial blood pressure in the same range (≤70 mm Hg). Noninvasive blood pressure and invasive arterial blood pressure mean arterial pressures showed better agreement; acute kidney injury prevalence (p = 0.28) and ICU mortality (p = 0.76) associated with hypotensive mean arterial pressure readings (≤60 mm Hg) were independent of measurement technique. Conclusions Clinically significant discrepancies exist between invasive and noninvasive systolic blood pressure measurements during hypotension. Mean blood pressure from both techniques may be interpreted in a consistent manner in assessing patients’ prognosis. Our results suggest that mean rather than systolic blood pressure is the preferred metric in the ICU to guide therapy. (Crit Care Med 2013;41:0–0)},

This year, we present 4 new recommendations, as well as revisions to 2 previous recommendations. In the diagnosis and assessment of hypertension, automated office blood pressure, taken without patient-health provider interaction, is now recommended as the preferred method of measuring in-office blood pressure. Also, although a serum lipid panel remains part of the routine laboratory testing for patients with hypertension, fasting and nonfasting collections are now considered acceptable. For individuals with secondary hypertension arising from primary hyperaldosteronism, adrenal vein sampling is recommended for those who are candidates for potential adrenalectomy. With respect to the treatment of hypertension, a new recommendation that has been added is for increasing dietary potassium to reduce blood pressure in those who are not at high risk for hyperkalemia. Furthermore, in selected high-risk patients, intensive blood pressure reduction to a target systolic blood pressure ≤~120 mm Hg should be considered to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events. Finally, in hypertensive individuals with uncomplicated, stable angina pectoris, either a β-blocker or calcium channel blocker may be considered for initial therapy. The specific evidence and rationale underlying each of these recommendations are discussed. Hypertension Canada's Canadian Hypertension Education Program Guidelines Task Force will continue to provide annual updates.},

The best way to avoid the many complications of CVDs is to manage and prevent hypertension at an early stage. However, there are no symptoms at all for most types of hypertension, especially for prehypertension. The awareness and control rates of hypertension are extremely low. In this study, a novel hypertension management method based on arterial wave propagation theory and photoplethysmography (PPG) morphological theory was researched to explore the physiological changes in different blood pressure (BP) levels. Pulse Arrival Time (PAT) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) features were extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and PPG signals to represent the arterial wave propagation theory and PPG morphological theory, respectively. Three feature sets, one containing PAT only, one containing PPG features only, and one containing both PAT and PPG features, were used to classify the different BP categories, defined as normotension, prehypertension, and hypertension. PPG features were shown to classify BP categories more accurately than PAT. Furthermore, PAT and PPG combined features improved the BP classification performance. The F1 scores to classify normotension versus prehypertension reached 84.34\%, the scores for normotension versus hypertension reached 94.84\%, and the scores for normotension plus prehypertension versus hypertension reached 88.49\%. This indicates that the simultaneous collection of ECG and PPG signals could detect hypertension.},

  abstract = {A photoplethysmogram (PPG) contains a wealth of cardiovascular system information, and with the development of wearable technology, it has become the basic technique for evaluating cardiovascular health and detecting diseases. However, due to the varying environments in which wearable devices are used and, consequently, their varying susceptibility to noise interference, effective processing of PPG signals is challenging. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the optimal filter and filter order to be used for PPG signal processing to make the systolic and diastolic waves more salient in the filtered PPG signal using the skewness quality index. Nine types of filters with 10 different orders were used to filter 219 (2.1s) short PPG signals. The signals were divided into three categories by PPG experts according to their noise levels: excellent, acceptable, or unfit. Results show that the Chebyshev II filter can improve the PPG signal quality more effectively than other types of filters and that the optimal order for the Chebyshev II filter is the 4th order.},

  abstract = {Tethered satellite system (TSS) by virtue of its unique structure is a promising way to study satellite formation, Earth ionosphere, electric generation, and space debris removal. Navigation is a key factor for the TSS to have a stable deployment process, as well as the maintenance stage. However, for the tethered Nano-satellites system (TNSS), there is no enough space for them to equip with micro-wave radar or other high power consumption sensors, so small and low-cost sensors are needed in our research program. In order to control the TSS precisely, the navigation issues including the absolute positioning algorithms and relative positioning scenario are investigated. In the absolute navigation problem, two failure conditions are studied. One is the GPS integrity monitoring, which is to identify the failure satellite and isolate it for the final solution by the progressive sample consensus (PROSAC) method. The other one is the GPS receiver failure. To improve the accuracy of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) navigation during this outage, an input-delay neural network (IDNN) is used to training IMU error model when GPS is availability. Unlike the traditional IDNN method only used the delayed input, this study employs the delayed target output as an additional input for training IDNN. In the relative navigation, a strategy is proposed by integrating the relative angles from camera and distance measurement from Xbee. Finally, tests and simulations validate the presented algorithms. © 2017 Proceedings of the Institute of Navigation Pacific Positioning, Navigation and Timing Meeting, Pacific PNT.},

  abstract = {Pulse transit time (PTT) has been a promising non-invasive and cuff-less method to measure blood pressure (BP). However, to achieve acceptable accuracy, subject specific and frequent calibration is required to model the complex non-linear dynamic between BP and PTT, limiting the practicality of PTT-based methods. The BP-PTT relationship is often modelled by the Moens-Korteweg (M-K) equation. Previous studies have found that the M-K equation is only able to model high frequency variations of BP, with low frequency variations modulated by the vasomotor tone, which is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). In this paper we present a novel calibration procedure that accounts for the influence of the SNS on the BP-PTT relationship. This is achieved by identifying the state of the SNS during calibration based on heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and PTT itself. The performance of the proposed procedure has been tested on 10 subjects over a period of 4 weeks. The results showed that the measurement differences were 1.04 mmHg ± 6.88 mmHg, and 2.16 mmHg ± 6.60 mmHg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed procedure was found to make a significant improvement of measurement precision when compared to the previous one-point calibration method, demonstrating the potential of the new procedure for accurate long-term BP tracking.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, machine learning systems have been proliferating in the healthcare industry domains, such as digital health, fitness tracking, patient monitoring, and disease diagnostics. In addition to this, with technological advancement, physiological sensors paired with artificial intelligence have acquired people’s attention because of their multifarious advantages. Such sensors are predominantly inexpensive, portable, easy to use and can help measure health parameters continuously and non-invasively using artificial intelligence. Technologies, such as PPG (Photoplethysmography) and ECG (Electrocardiography), are two promising techniques with immense potential that can track cardiovascular health with significant impact. In this survey paper, we aim to analyse, summarise, and compare the state-of-the-art methods for machine learning-based blood pressure estimation in a continuous, cuffless, and non-invasive manner by PPG biosignals. This survey divides the research work into two machine learning categories: shallow learning and deep learning. PPG feature extraction techniques and datasets are also presented in this paper. Additionally, a concise comparative analysis of PPG and ECG has been provided from the literature. Moreover, to compare different state-of-the-art traditional feature extraction techniques using PPG biosignals, we applied several machine learning algorithms to predict hypertension and heart rate estimation. Finally, we conclude by summarising critical implications and propose some promising future perspectives that will lead to advancements in this domain.},

  abstract = {Wind power plants have gained prominence in recent decades owing to their positive environmental and economic impact. However, the unpredictability of wind resources poses significant challenges to the secure and stable operation of the power grid. To address this challenge, numerous computational and statistical methods have been proposed in the literature to forecast short-term wind power generation. However, the demand for more accurate and reliable methodologies to tackle this problem remains. In this context, this paper proposes a new hybrid framework that combines a statistical pre-processing stage with an attention-based deep learning approach to overcome the shortcomings of existing forecasting strategies in accurately predicting multi-seasonal wind power time series. The proposed ensemble model involves a data transformation stage that normalizes the data distribution, along with modeling and removing multiple seasonal patterns from the historical time-series. Considering these results, the proposed model further incorporates an LSTM Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model with an attention mechanism, for each month of the year, to better capture the relevant temporal dependencies in the input residuals sequence. The model was trained and evaluated on hourly wind power data obtained from the Spanish electricity market, spanning the period from 2008 to 2019. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms well-established DL-based models, achieving lower error metrics. These findings have potential applications in energy trading, grid planning, and renewable energy management.},

  abstract = {Due to increasing health consciousness among people, it is imperative to have low-cost health care devices to measure the vital parameters like heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). In this paper, an efficient heart rate monitoring algorithm based on the morphology of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals to measure the spot heart rate (HR) and its real-time implementation is proposed. The algorithm does pre-processing and detects the onsets and systolic peaks of the PPG signal to estimate the heart rate of the subject. Since the algorithm is based on the morphology of the signal, it works well when the subject is not moving, which is a typical test case. So, this algorithm is developed mainly to measure the heart rate at on-demand applications. Real-time experimental results indicate the heart rate accuracy of 99.5\%, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.65\%, mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.18 BPM and reference closeness factor (RCF) of 0.988. The results further show that the average response time of the algorithm to give the spot HR is 6.85 s, so that the users need not wait longer to see their HR. The hardware implementation results show that the algorithm only requires 18 KBytes of total memory and runs at high speed with 0.85 MIPS. So, this algorithm can be targeted to low-cost embedded platforms.},

During active vasodilatation the intensity of transmitted light is decreased and the skin temperature rises; during congestion the light intensity is also decreased, but the skin temperature remains unchanged or falls; during vasoconstriction the light intensity is increased and the skin temperature falls. 2. The new method can be used not only for the study of vascular actions of drugs, but may also be applied to other fields of pharmacologic and physiologic research; for instance, the evaluation of sensory depressant or stimulating drugs and of local anesthetics. This application is based on the fact that the vessels of the rabbit's ear respond regularly to certain sensory stimuli with vasoconstriction.},

We tested the hypothesis that area under the curve (AUC) mean arterial pressure (MAP) {$<$}65 mm Hg is reduced by continuous invasive arterial pressure monitoring. METHODS: Adults having noncardiac surgery were randomly assigned to continuous invasive arterial pressure or intermittent oscillometric blood pressure monitoring. Arterial catheter pressures were recorded at 1-minute intervals; oscillometric pressures were typically recorded at 5-minute intervals. We estimated the arterial catheter effect on AUC-MAP {$<$}65 mm Hg using a multivariable proportional odds model adjusting for imbalanced baseline variables and duration of surgery. Pressures {$<$}65 mm Hg were categorized as 0, 1-17, 18-91, and {$>$}91 mm Hg × minutes of AUC-MAP {$<$}65 mm Hg (ie, no hypotension and 3 equally sized groups of increasing hypotension). RESULTS: One hundred fifty-two patients were randomly assigned to arterial catheter use and 154 to oscillometric monitoring. For various clinical reasons, 143 patients received an arterial catheter, while 163 were monitored oscillometrically. There were a median [Q1, Q3] of 246 [187, 308] pressure measurements in patients with arterial catheters versus 55 (46, 75) measurements in patients monitored oscillometrically. In the primary intent-to-treat analysis, catheter-based monitoring increased detection of AUC-MAP {$<$}65 mm Hg, with an estimated proportional odds ratio (ie, odds of being in a worse hypotension category) of 1.78 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-2.70; P = .006). The result was robust over an as-treated analysis and for sensitivity analyses with thresholds of 60 and 70 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative blood pressure monitoring with arterial catheters detected nearly twice as much hypotension as oscillometric measurements.},

  abstract = {An effective simulation of the urban sprawl in an urban agglomeration is conducive to making regional policies. Previous studies verified the effectiveness of the cellular-automata (CA) model in simulating urban sprawl, and emphasized that the definition of transition rules is the key to the construction of the CA model. However, existing simulation models based on CA are limited in defining complex transition rules. The aim of this study was to investigate the capability of two unsupervised deep-learning algorithms (deep-belief networks, DBN) and stacked denoising autoencoders (SDA) to define transition rules in order to obtain more accurate simulated results. Choosing the Beijing–Tianjin–Tangshan urban agglomeration as the study area, two proposed models (DBN–CA and SDA–CA) were implemented in this area for simulating its urban sprawl during 2000–2010. Additionally, two traditional machine-learning-based CA models were built for comparative experiments. The implementation results demonstrated that integrating CA with unsupervised deep-learning algorithms is more suitable and accurate than traditional machine-learning algorithms on both the cell level and pattern level. Meanwhile, compared with the DBN–CA, the SDA–CA model had better accuracy in both aspects. Therefore, the unsupervised deep-learning-based CA model, especially SDA–CA, is a novel approach for simulating urban sprawl and also potentially for other complex geographical phenomena.},

  abstract = {Most medical examinations include measuring of blood pressure because it is a very good indicator about the status of the cardiovascular system, and it helps medical doctors to adjust the ideal treatment. It would be very useful to know the profile of pressure values during long time period, especially during standard daily activities. It could be used for homecare monitoring and prevention of premature death. Problem is that blood pressure is monitored mainly at discrete time intervals and use an inflatable cuff placed around the arm, which is uncomfortable for the patient. Currently, there are a few technical solutions for continuous non-invasive measurement of blood pressure. This review is focused on the description of methods for continuous blood pressure measurement including their limitations and especially is focused on the description method based on pulse transit time. This method could be the most widely used of methods for non-invasive long time monitoring of blood pressure in the future but now there are still a lot of unsolved problems.},

  abstract = {The current blood pressure (BP) measurement devices are mostly built on the principle of auscultation, oscillometry or tonometry, all of which use an inflatable cuff to occlude or unload the artery. The need of a cuff in these devices limits the further reduction in size and power consumption, and restricts the frequency and ease of their usage. Therefore, this study aims to develop a cuff-less and noninvasive technique for measuring BP by pulse transit time. The technique was evaluated on 85 subjects, aged 57plusmn29 yrs., including 36 males and 39 hypertensives, over an average period of 6.4 wks. A total of 999 pairs of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimations were made. The average of BP readings reported by an experienced registered nurse and those obtained from a clinically approved automatic BP meter was used as reference. It is found that the estimated SBP and DBP differed from the reference BP by 0.6plusmn9.8 mmHg and 0.9plusmn5.6 mmHg respectively. When compared to the AAMI requirement (5plusmn8 mmHg for both SBP and DBP estimation), the results suggest that the cuff-less technology has great potential to be developed into wearable devices that are useful in self BP monitoring for home healthcare and eventually in clinical diagnosis},

A low-power wireless PPG device was custom-developed to monitor, acquire and analyze the arterial pulse in the finger. The system consisted of an optical sensor to detect arterial pulse as variations in reflected light intensity, signal conditioning circuitry to process the reflected light signal, a microcontroller to control PPG signal acquisition, digitization and wireless transmission, a receiver to collect the transmitted digital data and convert them back to their analog representations. A personal computer was used to further process the captured PPG signals and display them. A MATLAB program was then developed to capture the PPG data, detect the RR peaks, perform spectral analysis of the PPG data, and extract the HRV signal. A user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) was developed in LabView to display the PPG data and their spectra. The performance of each module (sensing unit, signal conditioning, wireless transmission/reception units, and graphical user interface) was assessed individually and the device was then tested as a whole. Consequently, PPG data were obtained from five healthy individuals to test the utility of the wireless system. The device was able to reliably acquire the PPG signals from the volunteers. To validate the accuracy of the MATLAB codes, RR peak information from each subject was fed into Kubios software as a text file. Kubios was able to generate a report sheet with the time domain and frequency domain parameters of the acquired data. These features were then compared against those calculated by MATLAB. The preliminary results demonstrate that the prototype wireless device could be used to perform HRV signal acquisition and analysis.},

The sensor, called a "ring sensor," is attached to a finger base for monitoring beat-to-beat pulsation, and the data is sent to a host computer via a radio-frequency transmitter. Two major design issues are addressed: one is to minimize motion artifact and the other is to minimize the consumption of battery power. An efficient double ring design is developed to lower the influence of external force, acceleration, and ambient light, and to hold the sensor gently and securely on the skin, so that the circulation at the finger may not be obstructed. Total power consumption is analyzed in relation to characteristics of individual components, sampling rate, and CPU clock speed. Optimal operating conditions are obtained for minimizing the power budget. A prototype ring sensor is designed and built based on the power budget analysis and the artifact-resistive attachment method. It is verified through experiments that the ring sensor is resistant to interfering forces and acceleration acting on the ring body. Benchmarking tests with FDA-approved PPG and electrocardiogram reveal that the ring sensor is comparable to those devices in detecting beat-to-beat pulsation despite disturbances.},

METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at a critical care department and post-anesthesia care unit of a university teaching hospital. Inclusion criteria were critically ill adult patients undergoing invasive BP measurement with an arterial catheter and PO monitoring. Exclusion criteria were arrhythmia, imminent death condition, and disturbances in the arterial or the PPG curve morphology. Arterial BP and finger PO waves were recorded simultaneously for 30 min. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) were extracted from computer-assisted arterial pulse wave analysis. Inherent traits of both waves were used to construct a regression model with a Deep Belief Network-Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DBN-RBM) from a training cohort of patients and in order to infer BP values from the PO wave. Bland-Altman analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 707 patients were enrolled, of whom 135 were excluded. Of the 572 studied, 525 were assigned to the training cohort (TC) and 47 to the validation cohort (VC). After data processing, 53,708 frames were obtained from the TC and 7,715 frames from the VC. The mean prediction biases were -2.98 ± 19.35, -3.38 ± 10.35, and -3.65 ± 8.69 mmHg for SAP, MAP, and DAP respectively. CONCLUSIONS: BP can be inferred from PPG using DBN-RBM modeling techniques. The results obtained with this technology are promising, but its intrinsic variability and its wide limits of agreement do not allow clinical application at this time.},

  abstract = {Objective We sought to develop an intensive care unit research database applying automated techniques to aggregate high-resolution diagnostic and therapeutic data from a large, diverse population of adult intensive care unit patients. This freely available database is intended to support epidemiologic research in critical care medicine and serve as a resource to evaluate new clinical decision support and monitoring algorithms. Design Data collection and retrospective analysis. Setting All adult intensive care units (medical intensive care unit, surgical intensive care unit, cardiac care unit, cardiac surgery recovery unit) at a tertiary care hospital. Patients Adult patients admitted to intensive care units between 2001 and 2007. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results The Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC-II) database consists of 25,328 intensive care unit stays. The investigators collected detailed information about intensive care unit patient stays, including laboratory data, therapeutic intervention profiles such as vasoactive medication drip rates and ventilator settings, nursing progress notes, discharge summaries, radiology reports, provider order entry data, International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, and, for a subset of patients, high-resolution vital sign trends and waveforms. Data were automatically deidentified to comply with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standards and integrated with relational database software to create electronic intensive care unit records for each patient stay. The data were made freely available in February 2010 through the Internet along with a detailed user’s guide and an assortment of data processing tools. The overall hospital mortality rate was 11.7\%, which varied by critical care unit. The median intensive care unit length of stay was 2.2 days (interquartile range, 1.1–4.4 days). According to the primary International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, the following disease categories each comprised at least 5\% of the case records: diseases of the circulatory system (39.1\%); trauma (10.2\%); diseases of the digestive system (9.7\%); pulmonary diseases (9.0\%); infectious diseases (7.0\%); and neoplasms (6.8\%). Conclusions MIMIC-II documents a diverse and very large population of intensive care unit patient stays and contains comprehensive and detailed clinical data, including physiological waveforms and minute-by-minute trends for a subset of records. It establishes a new public-access resource for critical care research, supporting a diverse range of analytic studies spanning epidemiology, clinical decision-rule development, and electronic tool development.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the accuracy of blood pressure (BP) measurements performed by primary care physicians (PCPs), and to assess whether it improves following a short theoretical training. METHODS: Observational study in 26 primary care practices in Geneva, Switzerland. The PCPs were asked to measure BP on 10 volunteers, within the usual context of their practice. Two trained research assistants repeated the measures immediately after the PCPs. The PCPs were then randomized to receive detailed training documentation on standardized BP measurement (group I: 14 doctors) or information about high BP (group II: 12 doctors). Measures were repeated a few weeks later. We computed accuracy and diagnostic categorization of high BP comparing the PCPs' measurements to the average value of four measurements by the research assistants (gold standard). T-tests were used to compare measurements between the two educational groups, both at baseline and following exposure to the educational material. RESULTS: BP measurements were performed on 257 volunteers at baseline and 251 after training. At baseline, the mean BP difference between PCPs and the gold standard were 23.0 mmHg (21.3-24.6) for systolic and 15.3 mmHg (14.3-16.3) for DBP. Following training, the mean difference remained high [group I: 22.3 mmHg (20.4-24.2) and 14.4 mmHg (12.6-16.2); group II: 25.3 mmHg (22.7-27.9) and 17.0 mmHg (15.3-18.7)]. As a result, 24-32\% volunteers were misdiagnosed as having systolic hypertension and 15-21\% as having diastolic hypertension. CONCLUSION: Though widely used in the assessment of hypertension in ambulatory settings, in-office BP measurements are highly inaccurate, even following training.},

For years, the cuff-based sphygmomanometer and the arterial invasive line have been the gold standards for care professionals to assess BP. During the past few decades, the wide spread of the oscillometry-based BP arm or wrist cuffs have made home-based BP assessment more convenient and accessible. However, the discontinuous nature, the inability to interface with mobile applications, the relative inaccuracy with movement, and the need for calibration have rendered those BP oscillometry devices inadequate for next-generation healthcare infrastructure where integration and continuous data acquisition and communication are required. Recently, the indirect approach to obtain BP values has been intensively investigated, where BP is mathematically derived through the “Time Delay” in propagation of pressure waves in the vascular system. This holds promise for the realization of cuffless and continuous BP monitoring systems, for both patients and healthy populations in both inpatient and outpatient settings. This review highlights recent efforts in developing these next-generation blood pressure monitoring devices and compares various mathematical models. The unmet challenges and further developments that are crucial to develop “Time Delay”-based BP devices are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Existing methods for arterial blood pressure (BP) estimation directly map the input physiological signals to output BP values without explicitly modeling the underlying temporal dependencies in BP dynamics. As a result, these models suffer from accuracy decay over a long time and thus require frequent calibration. In this work, we address this issue by formulating BP estimation as a sequence prediction problem in which both the input and target are temporal sequences. We propose a novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN) consisting of multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are incorporated with (1) a bidirectional structure to access larger-scale context information of input sequence, and (2) residual connections to allow gradients in deep RNN to propagate more effectively. The proposed deep RNN model was tested on a static BP dataset, and it achieved root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.90 and 2.66 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) prediction respectively, surpassing the accuracy of traditional BP prediction models. On a multi-day BP dataset, the deep RNN achieved RMSE of 3.84, 5.25, 5.80 and 5.81 mmHg for the 1st day, 2nd day, 4th day and 6th month after the 1st day SBP prediction, and 1.80, 4.78, 5.0, 5.21 mmHg for corresponding DBP prediction, respectively, which outperforms all previous models with notable improvement. The experimental results suggest that modeling the temporal dependencies in BP dynamics significantly improves the long-term BP prediction accuracy.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives In a significant portion of surgeries, blood pressure (BP) is often measured non-invasively in an intermittent manner. This practice has a risk of missing clinically relevant BP changes between two adjacent intermittent BP measurements. This study proposes a method to non-invasively estimate systolic blood pressure (SBP) with high accuracy in patients undergoing surgery. Methods Continuous arterial BP, electrocardiography (ECG), and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals were acquired from 29 patients undergoing surgery. After extracting 9 features from the PPG and ECG signals, we dynamically selected features upon each intermittent measurement (every 10~min) of SBP based on feature robustness and the principle of correlation-based feature selection. Finally, multiple linear regression models were built to combine these features to estimate SBP every 30~s. Results Compared to the reference SBP, the proposed method achieved a mean of difference at 0.08~mmHg, a standard deviation of difference at 7.97~mmHg, and a correlation coefficient at 0.89 (p~{$<~$}0.001). Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility of non-invasively estimating SBP every 30~s with high accuracy during surgery by using ECG, PPG, and intermittent SBP measurements every 10~min, which meets the standard of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. The proposed method has the potential to enhance BP monitoring in the operating room, improving patient outcomes and experiences.},

Error-correcting output coding (ECOC) method was adopted as a multi-classifier machine based on an aggregation of general binary classifiers. AdaBoost was applied as binary classifier machine. 368 volunteers participated in the experiment. The estimated systolic blood pressure (SBP) was calculated from their individual information and several features of their pulse wave (PW). As a result of the comparison between measured SBP, estimated SBP, MD = 3D-1.2 [mmHg] and SD = 3D11.7 [mmHg] were obtained. Hence, this technique would be helpful to the advance the development of continuous BP monitoring system, since the only one device to monitor BP is smaller than traditional measurements.},

  abstract = {The photoplethysmogram is widely used in medical settings and sports equipment to measure biological signals. The photoplethysmogram, which is measured noninvasively, can provide valuable information about cardiovascular system performance. The present study sought to investigate the underlying dynamics of photoplethysmographic signals from healthy young human subjects. In previous studies the photoplethysmogram was claimed to be driven by deterministic chaos [Tsuda 1992, Sumida 2000]; however, the methods applied for chaos detection were noise sensitive and inconclusive. Therefore, to reach a consistent conclusion it is important to employ additional nonlinear time series analysis tools that can test different features of the signal's underlying dynamics. In this paper, methods of nonlinear time series analysis, including time delay embedding, largest Lyapunov exponent, deterministic nonlinear prediction, Poincaré section, the Wayland test and method of surrogate data were applied to photoplethysmogram time series to identify the unique characteristics of the photoplethysmogram as a dynamical system. Results demonstrated that photoplethysmogram dynamics is consistent with the definition of chaotic movement, and its chaotic properties showed some similarity to Rossler's single band chaos with induced dynamical noise. Additionally it was found that deterministic nonlinear prediction, Poincaré section and the Wayland test can reveal important characteristics of photoplethysmographic signals that will be important tools for theoretical and applied studies on the photoplethysmogram.},

  abstract = {To evaluate the clinical application of the second derivative of the fingertip photoplethysmogram waveform, we performed drug administration studies (study 1) and epidemiological studies (study 2). In study 1, ascending aortic pressure was recorded simultaneously with the fingertip photoplethysmogram and its second derivative in 39 patients with a mean+/-SD age of 54+/-11 years. The augmentation index was defined as the ratio of the height of the late systolic peak to that of the early systolic peak in the pulse. The second derivative consists of an a, b, c, and d wave in systole and an e wave in diastole. Ascending aortic pressure increased after injection of 2.5 microg angiotensin from 126/74 to 160/91 mm Hg and decreased after 0.3 mg sublingual nitroglycerin to 111/73 mm Hg. The d/a, the ratio of the height of the d wave to that of the a wave, decreased after angiotensin from -0.40+/-0.13 to -0.62+/-0.19 and increased after nitroglycerin to -0.25+/-0.12 (P{$<$}0.001 and P{$<$}0.001, respectively). The negative d/a increased with increases in plethysmographic and ascending aortic augmentation indices (r=0.79, P{$<$}0.001, and r=0.80, P{$<$}0.001, respectively). The negative d/a reflects the late systolic pressure augmentation in the ascending aorta and may be useful for noninvasive evaluation of the effects of vasoactive agents. In study 2, the second derivative of the plethysmogram waveform was measured in a total of 600 subjects (50 men and 50 women in each decade from the 3rd to the 8th) in our health assessment center. The b/a ratio increased with age, and c/a, d/a, and e/a ratios decreased with age. Thus, the second derivative aging index was defined as b-c-d-e/a. The second derivative wave aging index (y) increased with age (x) (r=0.80, P{$<$}0.001, y=0.023x-1.515). The second derivative aging index was higher in 126 subjects with any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and ischemic heart disease than in age-matched subjects without such a history (-0.06+/-0.36 versus -0.22+/-0.41, P{$<$}0.01). Women had a higher aging index than men (P{$<$}0.01). The b-c-d-e/a ratio may be useful for evaluation of vascular aging and for screening of arteriosclerotic disease.},

  abstract = {Although photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals can be used to estimate blood pressure (BP) by extracting various features, the changes in morphological contours of both PPG and ECG signals due to various diseases of circulatory system and interaction of other physiological systems make the extraction of such features very difficult. In this work, we propose a waveform-based hierarchical Artificial Neural Network – Long Short Term Memory (ANN-LSTM) model for BP estimation. The model consists of two hierarchy levels, where the lower hierarchy level uses ANNs to extract necessary morphological features from ECG and PPG waveforms and the upper hierarchy level uses LSTM layers to account for the time domain variation of the features extracted by the lower hierarchy level. The proposed model is evaluated on 39 subjects using the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentations (AAMI) standard and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard. The method satisfies both the standards in the estimation of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). For the proposed network, the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) for SBP estimation are 1.10 and 1.56\,mmHg, respectively, and for DBP estimation are 0.58 and 0.85\,mmHg, respectively. The performance of the proposed hierarchical ANN-LSTM model is found to be better than the other feature engineering-based networks. It is shown that the proposed model is able to automatically extract the necessary features and their time domain variations to estimate BP reliably in a noninvasive continuous manner. The method is expected to greatly facilitate the presently available mobile health-care gadgets in cuffless continuous BP estimation.},

This study examines the relationships between arterial blood pressure and certain features of the photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals obtained from 15 young healthy subjects. Width of 1/2 pulse amplitude, width of 2/3 pulse amplitude, systolic upstroke time and diastolic time of the pulse were selected as features of the PPG signals. The experiment involved three sessions: rest, step-climbing exercise, and recovery from exercise. It was found that the diastolic time has higher correlation with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBF) than other features. The mean differences between the estimated and the measured blood pressure using a standard device are 0.21 mm Hg for SBP and 0.02 mm Hg for DBF. The corresponding standard deviations are 7.32 mm Hg for SBP and 4.39 mm Hg for DBF. The preliminary results indicate that it is possible to use the photoplethysmography only for cuffless and continuous estimation of arterial blood pressure.},

Advances in open hardware platforms and off-the-shelf photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors allow the non-intrusive collection of heart rate data at very low cost. However, the signal is not trivial to analyse, since the morphology of PPG waveforms differs from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and shows different noise patterns. Few validated open source available algorithms exist that handle PPG data well, as most of these algorithms are specifically designed for ECG data. In this paper we present the validation of a novel algorithm named HeartPy, useful for the analysis of heart rate data collected in noisy settings, such as when driving a car or when in a simulator. We benchmark the performance on two types of datasets and show that the developed algorithm performs well. Further research steps are discussed.},

As a first step toward SpO2-imaging we built a monochrome CMOS-camera with apochromatic lens and 3lambda-LED-ringlight (lambda1 = 660 nm, lambda2 = 810 nm, lambda3 = 940 nm; 100 LEDs lambda(-1)). We acquired movies at three wavelengths while simultaneously recording ECG and respiration for seven volunteers. We repeated this experiment for one volunteer at increased frame rate, additionally recording the pulse wave of a pulse oximeter. Movies were processed by dividing each image frame into discrete Regions of Interest (ROIs), averaging 10 x 10 raw pixels each. For each ROI, pulsatile variation over time was assigned to a matrix of ROI-pixel time traces with individual Fourier spectra. Photoplethysmograms correlated well with respiration reference traces at three wavelengths. Increased frame rates revealed weaker pulsations (main frequency components 0.95 and 1.9 Hz) superimposed upon respiration-correlated photoplethysmograms, which were heartbeat-related at three wavelengths. We acquired spatially resolved heartbeat-related photoplethysmograms at multiple wavelengths using a remote camera. This feasibility study shows potential for non-contact 2-D imaging reflection-mode pulse oximetry. Clinical devices, however, require further development.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elevated nocturnal blood pressure (BP) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. Cuffless BP assessment aided by machine learning could be a desirable alternative to traditional cuff-based methods for monitoring BP during sleep. We describe a machine-learning-based algorithm for predicting nocturnal BP using single-channel fingertip plethysmography (PPG) in healthy adults. METHODS: Sixty-eight healthy adults with no apparent sleep or CVD (53\% male), with a median (IQR) age of 29 (23-46 years), underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG) with fingertip PPG and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Features based on pulse morphology were extracted from the PPG waveforms. Random forest models were used to predict night-time systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). RESULTS: Our model achieved the highest out-of-sample performance with a window length of 7 s across window lengths explored (60 s, 30 s, 15 s, 7 s, and 3 s). The mean absolute error (MAE ± STD) was 5.72 ± 4.51 mmHg for SBP and 4.52 ± 3.60 mmHg for DBP. Similarly, the root mean square error (RMSE ± STD) was 6.47 ± 1.88 mmHg for SBP and 4.62 ± 1.17 mmHg for DBP. The mean correlation coefficient between measured and predicted values was 0.87 for SBP and 0.86 for DBP. Based on Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values, the most important PPG waveform feature was the stiffness index, a marker that reflects the change in arterial stiffness. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the potential of machine learning-based nocturnal BP prediction using single-channel fingertip PPG in healthy adults. The accuracy of the predictions demonstrated that our cuffless method was able to capture the dynamic and complex relationship between PPG waveform characteristics and BP during sleep, which may provide a scalable, convenient, economical, and non-invasive means to continuously monitor blood pressure.},

  abstract = {Pulse transit time (PTT) has attracted great interest for developing continuous and noninvasive blood pressure (BP) monitoring devices. This study investigated the effect of finger cold exposure on PTT. 13 healthy and normotensive subjects, including 6 males and 7 females took part in the experiment. Cold exposure was performed by asking subjects to immerse one finger into cold water (9\&\#177;2\&\#176;C) for 2 minutes. The photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals were recorded from the cooled and adjacent non-cooled finger simultaneously. PTT was measured between the R-wave of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and a fiducial point in finger PPG pulse for each heartbeat. Three definitions of PTT were investigated and the difference of PTT between two fingers was calculated for each subject. By comparing the difference before and after cold exposure, it was found that local cold exposure had little effect on PTT1, which terminates at the foot of the PPG pulse; however, it affected the PTT3, which terminates at the peak of the PPG pulse. The results suggest that the measurement of PTT which terminates at the foot of the PPG pulse is reliable, while those measurements which terminate at the peak of the PPG pulse or other fiducial points nearby are subject to the effect of local cold exposure and can possibly affect the accuracy of PTT-based applications.},

  abstract = {A ring-type device based on photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) can be worn by a person at all times for the noninvasive and continuous measurement of arterial blood pressure (BP). A motion-free PPG is very important in order to obtain accurate BP value. In this paper, the optimal finger-ring and circuit designs for stable PPG signal detection and accurate R-wave detection are presented. A series of comparative experiments are conducted on 10 subjects using various ring sensors with different configurations. The experimental results show that the convex-type ring sensor, in which light emitting diode (LED) and infrared (IR) detector are placed at the palm side, and separated by a distance of around 1cm, is the optimal choice for ring-type BP measurement.},
